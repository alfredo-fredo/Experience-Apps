<h3>App-developer student - iOS, Android, Webb & Cross-platform.</h3>

<p>I have a big interest in economy and personal finance so that led me to develop a few
        easy but very useful calculators to calculate investment potential, interest expenses etc.
        <br> All made with Android studio.

        <br>
        I have also used Flutter for cross-platform development and have a game published
        that i developed after a request from a friend.
