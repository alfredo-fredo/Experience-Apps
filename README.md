<p>I have a big interest in economy and personal finance so that led me to develop a few
        easy but very useful calculators to calculate investment potential, interest expenses etc.
        <br> All made with Android studio.

        I've also used Flutter for cross-platform development and have a game published
        that i developed after a request from a friend.
